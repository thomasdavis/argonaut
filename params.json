{"name":"Argonaut","body":"## Argonaut\r\n\r\n#### What is Argonaut?\r\n\r\nArgonaut is a JSON library built using Scala. It provides functionality to specify how to convert to and from JSON for an arbitrary Scala object. It relies on the Scala parser libraries (`util.parsing.combinator`) to read an arbitrary string into a JSON data type, which is known to be slow. Argonaut is licenced under BSD3 (see `etc/LICENCE`).\r\n\r\nThe JSON data type also implements a large combinator library in an effort to make it easy to use, however, much of this library would be better implemented by exploiting partial lenses and a zipper.\r\n\r\nArgonaut is intended for simple applications that use specification-compliant JSON. Argonaut is released under a [BSD3 open-source licence](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).\r\n\r\n#### Future Improvements\r\n\r\n* Exploit lenses and partial lenses for a more complete and general combinator library.\r\n* Implement a zipper for traversing the JSON data structure.\r\n* Implement a traversal cursor function that tracks its operations using the Writer monad.\r\n* Use a more appropriate parser library (not Scala parsers) to improve performance.\r\n* Implement automated tests for type-class laws (e.g. `ToJson` is the inverse of `FromJson`).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**Copyright 2012 Ephox Pty Ltd**","tagline":"JSON library","google":"UA-31861332-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
